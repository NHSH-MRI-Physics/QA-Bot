The QA Bot is a program desgined to watch a folder for a DICOM which matches the expected format. When a DICOM which matches is found it will be executed through the correct QA module. The results are then reported by whatever method (often email) that the specific module implements. 
# User Guide
To begin download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/NHSH-MRI-Physics/QA-Bot/releases). Please note this is currently only compiled for Mac since there is no requiremnt for a windows version but it is possible if required. Unzip into the desried folder, open the terminal and navigate to that folder. To run it use the command "sudo ./QA\ Bot", it may take several miniutes for it to load up but eventually the GUI below should appear.
